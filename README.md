## About  

Hey, Iâ€™m Gustavo, the developer behind **@Great-Visions-Code**. My coding journey started in 2024, and since then, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into iOS development. What began as just learning Swift has evolved into something much biggerâ€”I want to build **full-stack** applications that bring ideas to life from end to end.  

Right now, my focus is on creating **engaging, functional, and user-friendly iOS apps**, but Iâ€™m also expanding my skills beyond just mobile. Whether itâ€™s backend development, UI/UX, or learning how to integrate APIs effectively, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve and grow.  

## What Iâ€™m Into  

- **iOS Development** â€“ Everything from designing intuitive interfaces to writing clean, efficient Swift code.  
- **Expanding My Stack** â€“ Learning more about backend services, databases, and cloud functions to build complete apps.  
- **Problem-Solving** â€“ Whether itâ€™s a tricky SwiftUI animation or debugging API calls, I enjoy figuring things out.  

## Currently Learning  

Right now, Iâ€™m working on:  
- **Step by Step** â€“ A gamified step counter that blends fitness with interactive storytelling.  

## Letâ€™s Connect  

Iâ€™m always open to meeting other devs, sharing ideas, and collaborating. If youâ€™re into iOS development, full-stack applications, or just tech in general, feel free to reach out!
