## About

Hi there! I'm the person behind **@Great-Visions-Code**. My coding journey kicked off in 2024, and it's been an exciting ride ever since. While my primary focus is iOS development, this journey has opened my eyes to the vast ecosystem that surrounds app development. I've found myself diving into various languages and technologies that all play a part in creating something truly special. Now, I'm not just building apps—I'm working toward making them full-stack, bringing together the front-end and back-end seamlessly.

## Interests

- **iOS Development:** I'm passionate about the entire lifecycle of app development, from the initial spark of an idea to deploying a polished product in the App Store. Each step is a learning opportunity, and I love exploring how all the pieces fit together.
  
- **Expanding the Skillset:** As I've grown, so has my interest in other languages and frameworks. Whether it's exploring Swift, experimenting with backend services, or learning how to integrate APIs, I’m committed to developing a well-rounded skill set that goes beyond just the iOS platform.

## Currently Learning

I'm currently immersing myself in all things iOS development. This involves refining my skills in UI/UX design, diving deep into Swift and SwiftUI, and ensuring I fully grasp Apple's guidelines for app submissions. But it doesn’t stop there—I’m also learning how to build full-stack applications, connecting the dots between the client side and the server side to create more dynamic and robust apps.

## Connect

I’m always open to collaboration, learning, and sharing insights. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, I’d love to connect and grow together.
