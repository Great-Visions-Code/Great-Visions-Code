## About Me

In 2024, I decided to learn how to codeâ€”and stuck with it. What started with Swift has grown into a passion for creating apps that are practical, thoughtful, and user-driven.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on iOS development, especially using **SwiftUI** to design clean, engaging interfaces. Iâ€™ve also been learning how to build out entire app experiencesâ€”from UI and logic to data persistence and HealthKit integration.

My background isnâ€™t traditional tech, which gives me a different perspective. Iâ€™m here to keep learning and ship things that work.

## Current Project

### **Step by Step**
A gamified step tracker that blends storytelling and fitness. Think survival RPG meets daily walking challenge. You take steps in the real world to earn energy and unlock choices in a zombie apocalypse narrative.  
This project has pushed me to:

- Build real-time UI with SwiftUI  
- Integrate Apple HealthKit for step data  
- Design and iterate user flows and progress mechanics  
- Use MVVM to keep the codebase maintainable

## Learning Goals

- Strengthen my Swift and SwiftUI fundamentals  
- Level up my architecture skills (MVVM, modular design, etc.)  
- Improve my UI/UX design process and visual polish  
- Publish a complete app to the App Store
